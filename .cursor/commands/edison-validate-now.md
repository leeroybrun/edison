# edison-validate-now

Workflow: run the configured validators on the current context and record evidence.

Use this to get fast feedback before marking a task as `done`, or as a
final check before promotion.


## Usage

```bash
edison qa validate --current
```




## When to use

- You want feedback while still implementing
- You want a pre-flight validation run before task-ready

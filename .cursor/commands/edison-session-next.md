# edison-session-next

Workflow: compute next steps for the current session.

Use this whenever you are unsure what Edison expects next. It reads
session/task/QA state and returns the recommended next actions.


## Usage

```bash
edison session next
```




## When to use

- You just finished a step and want the next step
- You're resuming work after a break
- You suspect you're blocked by a guard/state mismatch

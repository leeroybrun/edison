## MANDATORY: Constitution

**This is a MANDATORY READ.** You MUST read your role-specific constitution file FIRST before any work.

### Re-Read Requirements

**You MUST re-read your constitution:**
- At the START of every new session
- After ANY context compaction
- Whenever you notice the constitution is no longer in your context
- When instructed by the user

### Constitution Locations

| Orchestrator | `.edison/_generated/constitutions/ORCHESTRATOR.md` |
| Agent (Implementer) | `.edison/_generated/constitutions/AGENTS.md` |
| Validator | `.edison/_generated/constitutions/VALIDATORS.md` |

**Determine your role from the task assignment, then read the appropriate constitution.**

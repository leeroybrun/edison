  "notesForValidator": "Workstream B: Test Infrastructure & Real Validation - Replaced stubbed bundle validation test with real CLI calls, added consensus testing (all approve vs one blocks), added dependency blocking test (parent cannot promote when child in wip), and added bundle-on-parent-only test (validators run on parent, not children individually). All 4 new tests pass. No regressions in existing test suite.",
  "implementationNotes": "Implementation followed E2E Validation Report (.agents/E2E_VALIDATION_POST_WORKFLOW_CHANGES.md) Workstream 2 specification. Key changes: 1) test_09 lines 376-542 - replaced fake wrapper with real validators/validate CLI, added consensus test for reject scenario. 2) test_11 lines 489-676 - added dependency blocking test and bundle-on-parent-only test. All tests use REAL CLI commands with proper AGENTS_PROJECT_ROOT environment setup.",

    "redEvidence": "Tests written to verify REAL CLI behavior before any test code changes. Test failures documented in cmd-1-test-run.log showing parent blocking when child in wip.",

    "notes": "TDD approach: 1) Identified gap in test_09 (stubbed validation), 2) Wrote test calling REAL CLI, 3) Fixed environment setup (AGENTS_PROJECT_ROOT), 4) Verified all tests pass. Same pattern for dependency blocking and bundle-on-parent tests."

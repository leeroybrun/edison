# Plan Mode governance: PLANNER guardrails (read-only outside .project/*) + reusable includes

## Summary

Formalize Plan Mode governance so “planning” sessions are safe and predictable:
- Planning is read-only outside Edison-managed planning artifacts.
- Planner outputs must be structured and approval-gated.
- These constraints must survive context compaction (constitution/include-based).

This task implements a “PLANNER” rule set as reusable includes that:
- can be embedded into the ORCHESTRATOR constitution (durable)
- can be embedded into Plan Mode start prompt and plan-related slash commands (bootstrap + consistent UX)

## Required Reading

- Prompt/constitution DRY rules: `docs/PROMPT_DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Compaction durability task: `.project/tasks/todo/002-prompts-constitutions-compaction.md`
- Plan Mode canonical doc: `.project/plans/plan-1-plan-mode.md`
- Spec‑Kit constitution/plan guardrails patterns:
  - `/tmp/edison-vendor-commands/spec-kit/templates/commands/constitution.md`
  - `/tmp/edison-vendor-commands/spec-kit/templates/commands/plan.md`

## Objectives

- [ ] Create a single canonical include-only file for Plan Mode governance (planner guardrails), e.g.:
  - `src/edison/data/guidelines/includes/PLANNER_GUARDRAILS.md`
- [ ] The include must specify:
  - Allowed write scope in Plan Mode: `.project/plans/**`, `.project/tasks/**`, `.project/qa/**` (and `.project/logs/**` if needed)
  - Forbidden changes until approval: no `src/**`, no config, no templates, no generated IDE outputs
  - Required grounding steps: run deterministic audits first (`task audit`, `task waves`, and later `plan validate`)
  - Approval gating: edits require explicit approval; prefer minimal diffs
  - Halt conditions: stop if prerequisites are missing or plan/task state invalid
- [ ] Ensure ORCHESTRATOR constitution includes the durable planner guardrails (compaction safe), via include-only section (no duplication).
- [ ] Ensure Plan Mode start prompt (`START_PLAN_MODE`) includes the bootstrap portion and points to the constitution/include for full rules.
- [ ] Ensure all plan-related slash commands reference the planner guardrails include (consistency).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] There is exactly one canonical planner guardrails include file; content is not duplicated across prompts.
- [ ] Post-compaction, re-reading ORCHESTRATOR constitution restores Plan Mode governance.
- [ ] Plan Mode prompts/commands consistently enforce “read-only outside .project/*” until approved.

## Files to Create/Modify

```
# Add
src/edison/data/guidelines/includes/PLANNER_GUARDRAILS.md

# Modify (likely)
src/edison/data/start/START_PLAN_MODE.md
src/edison/data/commands/plan/*.md
```

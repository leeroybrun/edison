# Plan Mode: drift detection + plan↔tasks sync/update workflows (no duplicate tasks)

## Summary

Once Plan Mode can generate tasks, Edison must also support safe evolution:
- detect plan drift after generation
- avoid generating duplicates or diverging competing task sets
- provide explicit workflows to sync/update tasks when a plan changes

This task plans (and later implements) deterministic drift detection + sync operations, plus matching slash command workflows.

## Required Reading

- `.project/plans/plan-1-plan-mode.md` (generation_history, task_id_prefix, drift concerns)
- `.project/tasks/todo/26.7-wave3-plan-spec-validate-and-similarity.md` (validate output contract)
- `.project/tasks/todo/26.8-wave3-plan-generate-tasks.md` (generation write-back)
- OpenSpec validate UX reference: `/tmp/edison-vendor-commands/OpenSpec/src/commands/validate.ts`
- BMAD correct-course workflow reference: `/tmp/edison-vendor-commands/BMAD-METHOD/src/modules/bmgd/workflows/4-production/correct-course/checklist.md`

## Objectives

### Deterministic drift detection
- [ ] Extend plan write-back (`generation_history`) to store a stable fingerprint of the Plan Spec used for generation:
  - e.g. `spec_hash` = sha256 of normalized `yaml edison-plan` block
- [ ] Add drift rules:
  - If plan spec hash differs from last generation, `edison plan generate-tasks` must fail closed unless `--force` (or explicit `--allow-drift`) is provided.
  - Provide a deterministic drift summary (what keys/titles/waves changed).

### Sync/update workflows (planned interface)
- [ ] Plan a `edison plan sync-tasks <plan-id>` CLI (future work) with modes:
  - `--dry-run` (default): print proposed task changes
  - `--apply` (explicit): apply changes
  - operations include: add missing tasks, mark removed tasks as archived/blocked, update titles/acceptance, update dependencies
  - strictly avoid rewriting task bodies wholesale; prefer targeted edits

### Slash command workflows
- [ ] Add plan-mode slash command definition `src/edison/data/commands/plan/plan-sync-tasks.md`:
  - read-only by default
  - requires `plan validate --json` + `plan tasks --json`
  - outputs “proposed sync plan” + ask gate
- [ ] Add a related “plan refine” command definition:
  - `src/edison/data/commands/plan/plan-refine.md` (bounded questions + targeted edits, Spec‑Kit clarify style)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Drift is detected deterministically and surfaced clearly.
- [ ] Regeneration never silently creates duplicate/competing task sets.
- [ ] Sync workflows are approval-gated and minimize edits (targeted diffs).
- [ ] Outputs follow OpenSpec-style validator UX: structured JSON (for CLIs), and clear next steps.

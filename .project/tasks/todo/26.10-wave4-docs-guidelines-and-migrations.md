# Docs/guidelines update: Plans are first-class Edison-managed artifacts

## Summary

Update Edison guidelines so `.project/plans/` is recognized as an Edison-managed artifact (like tasks/qa), not an “unapproved ad-hoc report folder”.

Also add minimal docs for:
- how to use Plan Mode
- how Plan→Tasks generation works
- how to interpret planner waves/batches (depends_on vs resource_locks)

## Required Reading

- `.project/plans/plan-1-plan-mode.md`
- `src/edison/data/guidelines/orchestrators/SESSION_WORKFLOW.md` (currently says tasks/qa only)
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` (commands system section)
- `src/edison/data/config/commands.yaml` (platform config + selection)
- `src/edison/data/commands/**` (command definitions)

## Objectives

- [ ] Update guidelines to explicitly allow `.project/plans/` as a first-class management artifact.
- [ ] Document Plan Mode workflow (short, canonical, config-driven).
- [ ] Add/adjust any “do not create ad-hoc docs” wording so it doesn’t conflict with Plans.
- [ ] Document how Edison “commands” are now defined and composed:
  - definitions live as layered markdown under `src/edison/data/commands/**` (and user/project overlays)
  - `src/edison/data/config/commands.yaml` controls platform outputs + selection only
  - pruning semantics: generated command outputs converge; stale generated files are removed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No guideline contradicts Plan Mode’s existence.
- [ ] Docs clearly differentiate:
  - plan docs (initiative-level)
  - tasks (implementation units)
  - QA (validation records)

# Edison Delivery Tracker

_Last updated: 2025-10-18_

This document is the single source of truth for Edison‚Äôs delivery status. Every contributor **must update this file** whenever work is completed, scope changes, or new risks emerge.

---

## 1. Current Snapshot

- **Build/Test Status**
  - `pnpm --filter @edison/web build` ‚Üí ‚úÖ passes (Next build + type checking clean after Tailwind + TS fixes).
  - `pnpm --filter @edison/web exec tsc --noEmit` ‚Üí ‚úÖ (shared type errors resolved, local `diff` declarations in place).
  - `pnpm --filter @edison/shared build` ‚Üí ‚úÖ (bundler-aware tsconfig produces CJS/ESM bundles + declarations).
  - `pnpm --filter @edison/api build` ‚Üí ‚úÖ (tsup + `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` now emit JS and `.d.ts` artifacts).
  - `pnpm --filter @edison/api test` ‚Üí ‚úÖ passes (Vitest suites still limited to targeted units).
  - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://edison:password@localhost:5432/edison pnpm --filter @edison/api prisma migrate deploy` ‚Üí ‚úÖ applies schema (two migrations).
  - `pnpm db:seed` ‚Üí ‚úÖ seeds admin/project/dataset/experiment when Postgres is up; script guides if DB or schema missing.
  - No Playwright or end-to-end validation configured.
- **Runtime**
  - `docker compose up` starts services; telemetry + Redis connection regressions resolved, but orchestration still incomplete so queues cannot finish an iteration.
  - Initial Prisma migration (`20251018140000_init`) authored; `pnpm db:seed` now provisions demo data once Postgres is reachable (script gracefully errors if DB is offline or creds wrong).
- **Frontend**
  - Tailwind pipeline now wired up, but dashboard pages depend on API endpoints and orchestration data that are not yet functional. Styling incomplete relative to shadcn/ui spec.
- **Backend**
  - Prisma client regenerated against committed schema; JSON helpers added to satisfy Prisma 5 input types; type-level debt across services (Bedrock/Vertex adapters, TRPC routers, audit logger) cleared.
  - Queue orchestration emits events, but lifecycle, safety, aggregation, and refinement logic still have TODO-equivalent gaps (missing scoring, judge integration, approval flow persistence).
- **Observability & Ops**
  - OpenTelemetry NodeSDK initialized, yet no instrumentations configured; metrics/exporters optional depending on env vars.
  - No alerting, dashboards, or health checks beyond `/healthz`.
- **Security & Access**
  - JWT-based auth in place; password hashing utilities exist.
  - RBAC enforced in some routers via `assertProjectMembership`, but coverage incomplete (missing auth guards on review/sse routes, etc.).

## 2. Alignment vs Specification

| Area | Spec Expectation | Current State | Gap Severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Model** | Comprehensive project/experiment/run schema with migrations | Schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`, but no migrations/generated client; seed data absent | **Critical** |
| **LLM Integrations** | Multi-provider adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex, Bedrock, Azure, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible) with validation, cost modeling | Adapter classes stubbed with partial logic; type errors (Bedrock/Vertex); provider credential rotation + caching incomplete | **Critical** |
| **Experiment Orchestration** | Queue-driven pipeline (execute ‚Üí judge ‚Üí aggregate ‚Üí safety ‚Üí refine) with SSE updates and budget enforcement | Worker registrations exist but rely on incomplete services (`BudgetEnforcer`, `PromptRefiner`, `SafetyService`). No end-to-end iteration success path proven. | **Critical** |
| **Frontend UX** | App Router dashboard, shadcn/ui components, SSE streaming dashboards, credential management | Skeleton pages + wizard UI only; no interactive TRPC integration verified; SSE client pieces missing; styling baseline only | **High** |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | Review workflows, diff viewer, approvals, audit logs | Review card UI exists, but backend routes partially implemented; audit log service writes but untested; approvals not persisted end-to-end | **High** |
| **Testing** | Vitest unit coverage, Playwright E2E, MSW for mocking | Only targeted Vitest suites for shared schemas & a few services; no integration/E2E tests | **High** |
| **Observability** | Metrics, tracing, structured logs, cost dashboards | Logging exists (Pino); telemetry skeleton but no spans/instrumentations; cost tracking table populated per run but no rollups or dashboards | **Medium** |
| **Security & Compliance** | RBAC, credential vaulting, audit trails, rate limiting, safety guardrails | Some RBAC and audit logging, rate limiter stub; credential encryption/storage strategy unspecified; safety service incomplete | **High** |
| **Docs & Ops** | Deployment guide, environment parity, migration strategy | Docker compose works for local dev; lacking production deployment instructions, migration process, runbooks | **Medium** |

## 3. Immediate Blockers

1. **API DTS build gap** ‚Äì `pnpm --filter @edison/api build` fails at the `.d.ts` phase because `rollup-plugin-dts` lacks Bundler-resolution support; need alternate config (NodeNext build tsconfig, or swap tool) so publish artifacts include typings.
2. **No database migrations applied** ‚Äì Initial migration exists but automated apply/seed workflow still missing; iteration pipeline will fail once data access begins.
3. **Unfinished orchestration pipeline** ‚Äì Workers reference services that are incomplete or lack safety checks; inability to complete a single experiment iteration.
4. **Credential/LLM adapter validation** ‚Äì Need concrete implementations for all providers (handling provider-specific params, error paths, cost estimation, streaming).
5. **Frontend dependency on unimplemented TRPC routes** ‚Äì UI fetches `run.listByExperiment`, `review.listSuggestions`, etc., but endpoints either stubbed or failing due to upstream gaps.

## 4. Phased Delivery Plan

| Phase | Objective | Exit Criteria | Key Deliverables | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 0 ‚Äì Foundations** | Make repo buildable & bootable end-to-end | `pnpm -r build` & `pnpm -r test` succeed; migrations generated and applied; Prisma client regenerated; all TypeScript strict errors resolved | Migrations, regenerated Prisma client, type fixes, `diff` typings, Tailwind pipeline finalized | üöß In Progress |
| **Phase 1 ‚Äì Orchestration Core** | Execute a full experiment iteration locally | Background workers complete execute‚Üíjudge‚Üíaggregate‚Üírefine pipeline on sample data; SSE stream reflects lifecycle; TRPC endpoints return real data | Fully implemented services (budget, safety, aggregation, refinement), BullMQ flows, deterministic test dataset | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| **Phase 2 ‚Äì Frontend Experience** | Deliver spec-compliant dashboard & review UX | Project dashboard lists data, wizard creates experiments, iteration detail page streams updates, review workflow operational | Solid design system (Tailwind + shadcn), SSE client, TRPC hooks, AI-assist components, credential management UI | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| **Phase 3 ‚Äì Quality & Compliance** | Harden app for production | Playwright E2E, Vitest coverage on services, audit log verification, rate limiting, security posture, cost monitoring dashboards | Test harnesses, MSW mocks, CI scripts, runbooks, alerting configuration | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| **Phase 4 ‚Äì Launch Readiness** | Final polish & documentation | Performance benchmarks hit; production deployment guide; smoke tests under docker compose; release notes | Prod config, migration checklist, telemetry dashboards, documentation suite | ‚è≥ Not Started |

## 5. Near-Term Backlog (Phase 0)

### Data & Tooling
- [x] Author initial Prisma migration set aligned with `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- [x] Run `prisma generate` and commit updated client; ensure `@prisma/client` version matches schema.
- [x] Seed minimal development data (admin user, sample project, dataset, experiment) to unblock UI.
  - [x] Seed script handles missing DB/invalid creds with actionable error and migration reminder.

### Type System Repairs
- [ ] Configure project references so `@edison/shared` resolves without manual path hacks (consider `.d.ts` barrel or package exports). *(In progress via package exports + build pipeline; remaining step: remove root tsconfig path alias once consumer builds stabilise.)*
- [x] Add local `diff` module declarations; eliminate implicit `any` parameters across API & web.
- [x] Update LLM adapter types to satisfy SDK changes (Bedrock `InferenceConfiguration`, Vertex `GenerationConfig`, etc.).
- [x] Define `@edison/shared` package exports so bundlers/builds resolve compiled outputs rather than tsconfig-only aliases.
- [x] Introduce dedicated build configs so `@edison/shared` and `@edison/api` emit TypeScript declarations without relying on tsconfig shortcuts.

### Build & Tooling Hygiene
- [ ] Add `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` to CI (GitHub Actions or alternative) once builds succeed locally.
- [ ] Document developer setup (prereqs, env vars, seeding) in README.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SDK/API churn (Prisma, provider SDKs) | Breaks adapters & type safety | Pin versions, add integration tests, monitor release notes |
| Queue orchestration complexity | Hard-to-debug failures across workers | Add structured event logging, local worker simulator, unit tests per service |
| Data privacy & credential safety | Sensitive model keys stored insecurely | Implement encryption-at-rest (KMS or libsodium), restrict logging, rotate secrets |
| Lack of automated tests | Regression risk | Introduce contract tests (shared schemas), service unit tests, E2E flows |

# Important Rules - Include-Only File

<!-- WARNING: This file is for {{include-section:}} only. DO NOT read directly. -->

- **TDD is mandatory**: always show RED → GREEN → REFACTOR evidence.
- **No hardcoded behavior**: behavior and thresholds must come from YAML configuration (no magic constants).
- **Anti-patterns**: do not ship TODOs/placeholders, do not weaken tests to “get green”, and do not bypass validation/security boundaries.

# Layer Stack Configuration (bootstrap)
#
# This file is read early to determine which overlay layer roots exist.
# Additional layers are inserted into the default overlay stack:
#   user (~/.edison) → project (<repo>/.edison)
#
# Example: insert a company layer before user:
#
# layers:
#   roots:
#     - id: mycompany
#       path: /opt/company/edison
#       before: user
#
layers:
  roots: []

# edison/core/config/constitution.yaml
# Defines mandatory and optional reads for each role type in the Edison framework
#
# ARCHITECTURE NOTE (v2.0):
# All critical content is now EMBEDDED in the constitution/prompt files via
# {{include:}} and {{include-section:}}. mandatoryReads is empty because:
# 1. Constitution is embedded in each agent/validator prompt
# 2. Re-reading the prompt file = re-reading everything
# 3. No risk of forgetting to read separate files
# 4. No double-loading of content
#
# optionalReads are available for deep-dive when needed, but NOT required.

# Worktree Configuration
# Git worktree management for session isolation

worktrees:
  enabled: true
  baseBranchMode: "current"
  baseBranch: null
  # Default: keep all session worktrees inside the repository so client tool
  # permissions scoped to `./**` (e.g. Claude Code) can access them reliably.
  baseDirectory: ".worktrees"
  archiveDirectory: ".worktrees/_archived"
  branchPrefix: "session/"
  pathTemplate: ".worktrees/{sessionId}"
  sharedState:
    # Controls how `.project/*` and `.edison/_generated` are shared across session worktrees.
    # Git worktrees do not share untracked/ignored files, so a shared root keeps tasks/QA/session
    # metadata consistent regardless of the current session worktree.
    #
    # Modes:
    # - meta: Use a dedicated git worktree (default) at `metaPathTemplate` on `metaBranch`.
    # - primary: Use the primary checkout as the shared root.
    # - external: Use an explicit filesystem path (`externalPath`) as the shared root.
    mode: "meta"
    metaBranch: "edison-meta"
    metaPathTemplate: ".worktrees/_meta"
    # Additional repo-root relative paths to share via symlink into worktrees.
    #
    # This is intended for untracked "project meta" that should be shared across all
    # worktrees regardless of code branch (e.g. OpenSpec/Speckit state).
    #
    # IMPORTANT: Edison will NOT replace tracked paths with symlinks. If a path is
    # tracked on the code branch, it will be skipped (and must be migrated manually).
    #
    # Each entry supports:
    # - path: repo-root relative path (no absolute paths / no `..`)
    # - scopes: ["session"] (default), or ["primary","session"] to also link in primary
    # - type: "dir" (default) or "file"
    # - targetRoot: "shared" (default) or "primary"
    # - mergeExisting: true (default) to merge existing untracked content into the shared target
    # Recommended defaults for worktree meta/shared setups.
    # Projects can append additional items via:
    #   sharedPaths: ["+", {path: "foo", scopes: ["primary","session"]}]
    # Projects can disable a default by appending:
    #   sharedPaths: ["+", {path: ".pal", enabled: false}]

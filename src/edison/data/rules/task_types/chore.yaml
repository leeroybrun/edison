title: Maintenance Chore
applies_when:
  - "Non-feature maintenance such as dependency bumps, lint/format upgrades, CI/CD plumbing, or repository hygiene is required."
  - "Operational tasks like rotating keys, cleaning logs/artifacts, or updating automation scripts are in scope."
  - "No product behavior change is intended beyond maintenance impact."
validation_criteria:
  - "Change risk is assessed (breaking changes, migrations, tooling shifts) and mitigated with rollout steps."
  - "Tooling/lint/CI updates run successfully across the codebase; regenerated files are committed or reproducible."
  - "Configuration stays YAML-driven; no new hardcoded paths, tokens, or counts are introduced."
  - "Operational tasks leave systems in a clean, monitored state (alerts, dashboards, jobs)."
delegation_guidance:
  - "Route platform/build changes to feature-implementer or api-builder; UI build/tooling tweaks may involve component-builder."
  - "Use codex for precise dependency or tooling edits; claude/gemini for broader migration notes."
  - "Provide delegates with current CI logs, lockfiles, and target versions to avoid guesswork."
definition_of_done:
  - "CI pipelines pass with updated tooling; local bootstrap instructions remain accurate."
  - "Lockfiles, scripts, and docs are synchronized; no stray caches or temporary files remain."
  - "Operational cleanups verified (e.g., old artifacts removed, rotations completed) with evidence captured."
  - "Changelog or maintenance log captures the scope and potential impacts."

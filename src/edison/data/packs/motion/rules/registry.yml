  - id: RULE.MOTION.PREFER_TRANSFORMS
    title: Prefer transforms/opacity over layout for performance
    category: performance
    severity: warning
    sourcePath: packs/motion/guidelines/includes/motion/performance.md
    description: |
      Prefer transform/opacity animations (GPU-friendly) over animating layout properties.
      This reduces layout thrash and keeps motion animations smooth.

  - id: RULE.MOTION.USE_VARIANTS_FOR_STATE
    title: Use variants for state-driven motion
    category: maintainability
    severity: warning
    sourcePath: packs/motion/guidelines/includes/motion/variants-system.md
    description: |
      Use variants to centralize animation state and avoid duplicated animate props.

  - id: RULE.MOTION.GESTURES_ARE_INTENTIONAL
    title: Gesture handling must be intentional and constrained
    category: correctness
    severity: warning
    sourcePath: packs/motion/guidelines/includes/motion/gesture-handling.md
    description: |
      Gesture interactions (hover/tap/drag) should be constrained and tested.

  - id: RULE.MOTION.LAYOUT_ANIMATIONS_ARE_SCOPED
    title: Layout animations should be scoped to the smallest subtree
    category: performance
    severity: warning
    sourcePath: packs/motion/guidelines/includes/motion/layout-animations.md
    description: |
      Use layout animations for reflow/reorder, but keep the animated subtree small.

  - id: RULE.MOTION.ANIMATE_PRESENCE_KEYS
    title: AnimatePresence requires stable keys for exit animations
    category: correctness
    severity: warning
    sourcePath: packs/motion/guidelines/includes/motion/animate-presence.md
    description: |
      Ensure stable keys so exit animations can run correctly when components unmount.

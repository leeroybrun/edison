        instructions: |
          Install Node.js so `npx` is available.
          Ensure Playwright browsers are installed for your project:
            - npx playwright install --with-deps
          
          Notes:
            - This server is configured with `--isolated` to avoid state leakage across validation runs.
            - If you need a pre-authenticated session, prefer providing a `storageState` in your Playwright test harness.

# Component Design

<!-- WARNING: This file is for {{include-section:}} only. DO NOT read directly. -->

<!-- section: patterns -->
- Favor composition over inheritance; extract pure presentational pieces.
- Keep components small and focused; single responsibility.
- Co-locate tests and stories with components when appropriate.
- Use semantic HTML and descriptive props; avoid boolean prop proliferation.

## Concrete Checks
- Follow Rules of Hooks; no conditional hooks.
- Prefer Server Components; use Client Components for interactivity only.
- Add proper Suspense boundaries and meaningful fallback UI.
- Use `use()` for promise handling where appropriate in React 19.
- Ensure accessible names, roles, and keyboard navigation.

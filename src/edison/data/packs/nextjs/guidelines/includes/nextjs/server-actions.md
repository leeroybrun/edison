# Server Actions

<!-- WARNING: This file is for {{include-section:}} only. DO NOT read directly. -->

<!-- section: patterns -->
- Use `'use server'` to define mutations.
- Validate and coerce inputs on the server; never trust client data.
- Keep actions small and idempotent where possible.
- Revalidate as needed after mutations.

## Edison Workflow Loop

Follow this loop **every time** you take action.

### 📋 APPLICABLE RULES (read FIRST)
- Read the rule list FIRST, before choosing actions.
- If a rule blocks an action, do not proceed until it is satisfied.

### 🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS (read AFTER rules)
- Prefer the recommended CLI commands produced by `edison session next`.
- Execute the top-most BLOCKING items first.

### 🤖 DELEGATION HINT
- Delegate to specialized agents when the work is non-trivial.
- Keep tasks small, scoped, and independently verifiable.

### 🔍 VALIDATORS
- Review the validator roster and blocking validators before promotion.
- Triggered validators depend on the changed files; do not guess.

### Loop
1. Run: `edison session next <session-id>`
2. Read output in order: **APPLICABLE RULES → RECOMMENDED ACTIONS → DELEGATION HINT → VALIDATORS**
3. Execute the recommended command(s)
4. Repeat from step 1

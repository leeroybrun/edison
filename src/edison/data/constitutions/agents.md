## Workflow Requirements
1. Follow MANDATORY_WORKFLOW.md
2. When applicable, follow the Context7 workflow above and record required evidence markers
3. Generate implementation report upon completion
4. Handoff to the orchestrator for promotion and validation (agents do not move task/QA state by default)
